# DnDMapper
A tool suite for DMs

when creating branches, please follow the following naming conventions

when working on the Map editing section start the branch with an 'M'
followed by one of the following letters;
    P - point plotting systems
    E - edge toggling systems
    O - option systems (doors, min/max elevation, chests)
    S - saving system
then add a "-" with a three digit number starting at 001
so a branch working on the Map Point plotting system would be MP-001

if working on the campaign editing section start the branch with a 'C'
followed by one of the following letters;
    M - maps and linking maps together
    P - players mechanics
    E - enemy mechanics
    T - traps and items
    R - remote access
then add a "-" with a three digit number starting at 001
so a branch working on the campaign player mechanic system would be CP-001

once your make a branch, please record the number in the tracking.txt so that that other coders can see what numbers have been used
